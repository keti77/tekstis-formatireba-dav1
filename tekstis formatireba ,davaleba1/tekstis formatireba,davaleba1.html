        <b>Lorem Ipsum</b> is simply dummy <u>text</u> the printing and typesetting industry.<br><br>

       <b>Lorem Ipsum</b> has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the <mark>1500s</mark>, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.<br><br>
        
        It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the <mark>1690s</mark> with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like <b><del>
            Aldus PageMaker
        </del></b> including versions of Lorem Ipsum
